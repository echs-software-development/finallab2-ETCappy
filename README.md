Extra Lab2 work

ExtraLabQ1
1. Write a program that prompts a user to input two doubles and then prints these two doubles backward on the screen.

So if the user enters:

1.3   6.8
The program should output:

6.8 1.3
Notice there is exactly one space between the numbers.  How can you make a sopace apear in Java.  You may need to look it up.

Extra Lab Q2
Write a program that asks the user their name and age and prints out this information in a sentence as shown. Note that age should be an integer, not a double.

Sample run:

Hi there. What is your name?
Pascal
Hi Pascal. How old are you?
16
Pascal is 16 years old.

Extra Lab Q3

Write a program that takes a single integer input from the user and stores it in a variable. Your program should increase the value of this variable by one three times, printing "number is now " followed by its value each time, then decrease it by one three times, again printing "number is now " and the value each time. You must use unary operators to increase/decrease the value of the variable to receive full credit for this assignment.

Sample Run

Enter starting number (must be an integer)
>24
number is now 25
number is now 26
number is now 27
number is now 26
number is now 25
number is now 24
